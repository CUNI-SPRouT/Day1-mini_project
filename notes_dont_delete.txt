Some random notes about the project

- Remember to update the analysis
- Check if the data is correct
- The plot colors might need to be changed
- Ask supervisor about the threshold value
- TODO: clean up the code
- TODO: organize files better
- TODO: add proper comments

Data sources:
- data_file1.csv: from experiment in January
- measurements.csv: downloaded from lab computer

Issues:
- Script doesn't run on other computers
- Paths are hardcoded
- Missing some package installations
- Need to document better

Future work:
- Make it more reproducible
- Add proper folder structure
- Use relative paths
- Document package versions
