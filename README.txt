# Analysis Project

This is my analysis project.

## How to run

1. Open the R script
2. Change the paths to match your computer
3. Make sure you have the packages installed
4. Run it and hope it works

## Files

- myanalysis.R - the main script
- Some data files are somewhere in the folder
- Outputs will be saved to various locations (check the script)

## Notes

- Don't delete anything!
- The script might not work on your computer because paths are different
- You need these packages: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, scales (maybe more?)
- Created on my laptop, not sure if it works elsewhere
